This folder contains the code running the entire analysis for our eLife paper. The analysis was run on July 3, 2021. 
The frozen data are stored in the `frozen-data` folder. For the exact sources of the data in the World Mortality Dataset see `frozen-data/world-mortality-sources.md`. 

The Python notebook saves all figures to the `figures` folder and outputs the analysis results as CSV files into the `export` folder. The figures (in PDF and in PNG) and the CSV files are provided here directly.
